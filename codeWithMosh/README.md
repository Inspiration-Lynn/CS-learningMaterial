## Front-end Development

Every web or mobile application has two parts: a front-end and a back-end. The front-end is what the user sees and interacts with. It’s the app on your phone or the website you visit. So, front-end developers are in charge of building beautiful, interactive user interfaces.

### HTML and CSS

Front-end development starts with HTML and CSS. These are the languages behind every web page on the Internet. My HTML/CSS series teaches you everything you need to know from absolute basics to advanced concepts.

### JavaScript

HTML and CSS are only used for building static pages. To add functionality to a page, you need to learn JavaScript.

### Libraries and Frameworks

Modern applications are complex. That's where front-end tools (libraries/frameworks) come to the rescue, helping us build and ship applications faster. The top 3 tools in this space are React, Angular, and Vue. Out of these, React is the most popular so that's what I recommend you learn first. You can always learn about other tools as needed.
